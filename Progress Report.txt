What Works/Good Things: 
- Google Gemini AI Functionailty
- Frontend looks amazing
- Docx files are now Compatible
- Fixed routing so /upload is now the default homepage
- Link between history and trash section has been added

What could be better:
- The AI itself could be better with the results
- The resulting text can be formatted to look better
- The personal information section could be removed
- The entire history section should be revamped to be cleaner and there should be a way to view original resumes and 
AI resumes side by side

Project Name: ResumAI - AI-Powered Resume Tailoring Platform
Current Progress:âœ…Â Core Features Implemented
* Resume upload system (text/file input)
* Job description linking/parsing
* History tracking (last 5 submissions)
* Trash/restore functionality
* Basic AI tailoring endpoint
âœ…Â Tech Stack
* Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
* Backend: Next.js API Routes
* Database: MongoDB Atlas
* State Management: React hooks
âœ…Â Key Functionality Working
* CRUD operations for resumes
* Soft delete system
* Basic responsive UI
ðŸ”§Â Current Challenges
* AI integration is working but could be better in displaying the output (Google Gemini API connectivity)
* File upload parsing incomplete; Only text files are working correctly
Next Development Priorities:
1. Immediate Fixes
    * AI optimization(may be a better prompt is needed?)
    * There should be a way to link the history section to the trash so that users can easily trash resumes From the history section 
2. Short-Term Features
    * PDF/DOCX parsing for uploaded resumes
    * Resume comparison view (original vs tailored)
    * Download options (PDF/Word export)
3. Long-Term Roadmap
    * User authentication system
    * Multi-resume templates
    * ATS score simulation
Technical Debt to Address:
* Standardize API response formats
* Implement proper error boundaries
* Add loading skeletons
Requested Assistance:Please provide:
1. PDF parsing solution that works with our current architecture
* Improve Resilience for File Uploads
* The file uploader currently reads text only. In the future, you could:
    * Parse PDFs or DOCX (using a backend API + pdf-parse or docx-parser)
    * Show file name and size
    * Reject unsupported formats gracefully
* Add Trash and Restore Buttons on History
* Improve Gemini AI tailoring (e.g., show job-resume match score, highlight changed parts)
* Add PDF/Docx parsing for file uploads
